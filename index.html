          <h1>Programming Portfolio</h1>
            <p>It has always been my desire to learn how to code and use my coding
            skills to improve the quality of human life. I decided to take the bold
            step to quit my employment and seek knowledge in the programming field
            in the IT industry. This will be my first step to master a challenging and
            equally interesting section of the IT field.</p>
          <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>As a child I always liked the outdoors and working with my hands. I grew
              with this habit through my primary school and with the keen interest and help
              of my father,<em>who is an electrical engineer</em>. I acquired a strong liking
              for Science and Mathematics. I always desired to be an engineer as well and after
              high school I pursued that line of study.</P>
            <p>I completed high school in 2006 and started my college education in 2008 till
              2012 at <a href="https://www.park.edu/">Park University</a>, where I graduated with a degree in IT Support and Management.
              I have since been working with various companies till June 2018 when I decided to pursued
              career advancement through further education in the coding field of IT.</p>
