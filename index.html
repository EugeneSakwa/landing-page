  <h1>Programming Portfolio</h1>
    <p>It has always been my desire to learn how to code and use my coding
    skills to improve the quality of human life. I decided to take the bold
    step to quit my employment and seek knowledge in the programming field
    in the IT industry. This will be my first step to master a challenging and
    equally interesting section of the IT field.</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>As a child I always liked the outdoors and working with my hands. I grew
      with this habit through my primary school and with the keen interest and help
      of my father,<em>who is an electrical engineer</em>. I acquired a strong liking
      for Science and Mathematics. I always desired to be an engineer as well and after
      high school I pursued that line of study.</P>
    <p>I completed high school in 2006 and started my college education in 2008 till
      2012 at <a href="https://www.park.edu/">Park University</a>, where I graduated with a degree in IT Support and Management.
      I have since been working with various companies till June 2018 when I decided to pursued
      career advancement through further education in the coding field of IT.</p>

    <p>As a network engineer with different organiizations, I found the work to
    be challenging and very exciting. However, in the recent past we have been
    encouraged to pursue programming so that we may be able to keep up with the
    changing dynamics of the networking industry with is getting away from hardware
    based switching and routing to software based solutions</p>
