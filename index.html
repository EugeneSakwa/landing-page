  <h1>Programming Portfolio</h1>
    <p>It has always been my desire to learn how to code and use my coding
    skills to improve the quality of human life. I decided to take the bold
    step to quit my employment and seek knowledge in the programming field
    in IT. This will be my first step to a challenging and equally interesting
    IT field.</p>
